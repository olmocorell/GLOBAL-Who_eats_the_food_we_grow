# Who eats the food we grow?
In this visualization project, I have created an API that allows us to see the data of the production of different foods in the countries and if they are used for food or feed. I have extracted the data from [this Kaggle dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production)

I used the Streamlit library

You can see it in [Heroku](https://foodwegrow.herokuapp.com/) using this link:
